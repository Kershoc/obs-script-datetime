# OBS Studio Date Time Script

Based on [DateTime.lua by Albin Kauffmann](https://gitlab.com/albinou/obs-scripts/)

Modified to accept a second source to allow splitting the date and time.

This script transforms up to 2 text sources into a digital clock. The datetime format is configurable and uses the same syntax as the Lua os.date() call.

## Howto install script in OBS Studio

- Download the script anywhere on your hard drive
- Go to Tools -> Scripts and add the downloaded script
